# Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations
This project is about predicting what bookings are likely to get cancelled for a given hotel. This is based on public dataset available from Kaggle:

Our goal is to to analyze the provided data to find which factors have a high influence on cancellations. Based on that we'll build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance.

This is a supervised learning classification task as we have labeled data with target variable. We would try various models/algos for this classification.
